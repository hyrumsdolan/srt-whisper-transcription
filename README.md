# Whipser Transcription to SRT Files

## Description
This readme is for some dude on reddit, so it's just brief instructions on how to use the script.

## Initial Setup
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
First add the audio file to the root directory (the main folder)
then run this command (replace audio file with you file name. i.e. `audio.mp3`):
`python3 app.py <audio_file> --output_dir SrtFiles`

If that doesn't work, copy your error message from the terminal into chatGPT
